    Fetch a large volume in chunks, and return the assembled result.
    The chunks can optionally be fetched in parallel, via a threadpool.
    
    Args:
        bounding_box:
            The location of the voxels to fetch
        
        grid:
            The chunking scheme
        
        fetch_fn:
            The function to use to fetch each chunk.
            Should have signature:
            
                subvol = fetch_fn(box)
        
        threads:
            If nonzero, fetch chunks in parallel, using a threadpool.
            For completely synchronous operation (no threadpool), use threads=0.
        
        dtype:
            Optional. If you know the dtype of the volume,
            you can pass it here as a tiny optimization.

            the threadpool is started, to determine the dtype.
