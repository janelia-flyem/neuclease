# were generated from the scale-1 mask overlaid with the scale-1 neuron segmentation,

# (For that reason, perhaps we should have generated these neighborhood objects using scale-1, too. Oh well.)

# downsampled via the exact same algorithm that was used to produce the scale-1 neuron segmentation
# (and thus it won't necessarily conform to the scale-1 mito boundaries).
# As a workaround, we will simply erode the neighborhood slightly to make sure we aren't
# catching mitos from nearby neurons in this analysis.
